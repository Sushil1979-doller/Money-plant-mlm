    <p class="faq-question">21. How do I copy my referral link?</p>
    <p class="faq-answer">
      When you click the Activate button, you'll see a "Distribute Funds" button. Once you click it, your funds are automatically distributed and that button disappears forever. At the same place, you'll then see a "Copy Referral Link" button and a "Join Telegram" button. Only activated users can copy their referral link, so you must distribute your funds first.
